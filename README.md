MIT M.Eng. Thesis
=================

"The thesis requirement gives students an opportunity to develop and
demonstrate their ability to carry out and document a reasonably
comprehensive project requiring considerable initiative, creative
thought, and a good deal of individual responsibility. The thesis may
be a design project, an analytical paper, or experimental work of a
technical nature."
