I would like to start by thanking Dr. Cynthia Breazeal for giving me the opportunity of being part of the Personal 
Robots Group and for guiding me through the completion of this thesis.  Almost fifteen years ago I read a 
newspaper article about Kismet and her, and it inspired me to venture into the field of engineering.  It has been 
an honor working with her on this project.

I would also like to thank Philipp Robbel and Siggi Adalgeirsson, who have helped me from the moment I 
started at the group.  To Philipp, for taking me as his UROP and advising me in early projects.  To Siggi, for 
always lending a hand whenever I needed it.

Thanks to Dr. Peter Szolovits, my longtime academic advisor, for his support and mentoring throughout my 
bachelors and masters. I would also like to thank Dr. Berthold K.P. Horn and Dr. Antonio Torralba for sparking 
my interests in computer vision.

Thanks to my parents, Omar and Arzoris, for always being a source of great inspiration and for their constant 
motivation to strive for excellence.  To my brother and sister, Javier Arturo and Arzoris Marian, for giving me the 
support that only they can provide.

Finally, I would like to thank the Institute for six rewarding years. Getting an education from MIT is indeed like 
taking a drink from a fire hose.
