\caption[Time performance of loop through all the pixels of an image buffer]{Time performance of loop through 
all the pixels of an image buffer. The tests were ran on image buffers of pixel depth \texttt{BYTE}, with 
one, two, and three channels. The tested image sizes were 80 x 60, 160 x 120, 320 x 240, 640 x 480, and 
1280 x 960.}
