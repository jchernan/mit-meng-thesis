The \Camera{} abstract class is the base representation of a camera in the \RD{} environment.  As listed in 
Table \ref{cameramethods}, this class defines methods to access information about a camera 
(\texttt{get\-Width}, \texttt{get\-Height}, \texttt{get\-Time\-stamp}, \texttt{get\-Frame\-Rate}), methods to capture 
images from the camera (\texttt{start\-Cap\-turing}, \texttt{grab\-Im\-age}), and methods to perform camera 
calibration (\texttt{start\-Cal\-i\-bra\-tion}).

By providing an abstract implementation, the \Camera{} class lets its subclasses describe different types of 
cameras while specifying a common structure for them.  In this framework, \ColorCam{} and 
\SwissRangerCam{} are the main examples of extending the \Camera{} class to represent 
cameras that capture different types of data: the first one represents a conventional color camera while 
the second one represents a 3D time-of-flight camera (see Sections \ref{colorcam} and \ref{swissrangercam}). 
This design allows a flexible definition of what a camera is and lets the user choose the representation 
of the data captured by a specific sensor.

Furthermore, an object of type \Camera{} is a subtype of \DataProvider{}. A data provider is an object that 
can publish user defined datatypes in \RD{}'s  intra-application communication system, allowing other objects 
called data handlers to subscribe to and receive the provided data. In the case of a \Camera{} object, 
the provided data is represented by the abstract class \CameraData{}. Subclasses of \CameraData{}
define the datatypes captured by different camera sensors. For example, \ColorCamData{} and 
\SwissRangerCamData{} represent the data provided by \ColorCam{} and \SwissRangerCam{}, respectively.
