The \DCJavaAcquire{} class establishes the Java interface to the libdc1394 library. Since libdc1394 is 
written in C, this class uses the Java Native Interface (JNI) framework to access the library functions.
The native methods declared in the Java layer are implemented in a separate C layer, and this
implementation is packaged in the \RD{} JNI library called libdc1394\-Ja\-va\-Ac\-quire. 

The \DCJavaAcquire{} class simplifies the access to a Firewire camera by declaring the methods listed
in Table \ref{dcjavaacquiremethods}. The \texttt{get\-GUIDs} method returns a list of GUIDs from the 
available Firewire cameras, and \texttt{start\-Cap\-tur\-ing}, \texttt{stop\-Cap\-tur\-ing}, and \texttt{get\-Im\-age}
are used to control and acquire images from them. The last two methods in the list are specific to Firewire 
cameras produced by Point Grey, and they are used to convert captured grayscale images to color images.
