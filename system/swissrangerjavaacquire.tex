The \SwissRangerJavaAcquire{} class establishes the Java interface to the SwissRanger driver. It uses the 
Java Native Interface (JNI) framework to access the native functions in the driver's library. The \RD{} Java layer 
declares native methods that are implemented in a C layer packaged in the \RD{} JNI library called 
libsrJavaAcquire. 

The \SwissRangerJavaAcquire{} class simplifies the access to a SwissRanger camera by declaring the 
method listed in Table \ref{swissrangerjavaacquiremethods}. Unlike \DCJavaAcquire{}, this class does not
declare \texttt{start\-Cap\-tur\-ing} nor \texttt{stop\-Cap\-tur\-ing} methods. The driver's library does not contain
functions equivalent to these operations since the camera is capturing from the moment it is created.
The \texttt{getImages} method is used to retrieve the images for all data types at the same time.
