The \SwissRangerPacketHandler{} class contains the information about how the Swiss\-Ranger data is encoded 
in incoming network packets. It is a subtype of \SafePacketHandler{}, and it is instantiated by the Swiss\-Ranger 
receiver in order to manage the Swiss\-Ranger image data transferred over the network.

Similar to the \ColorPacketHandler{}, this class uses a \PacketOrganizer{} in its implementation to sort and 
organize the large number of incoming packets (see Section \ref{packetorganizer}). The packet organizer puts 
together the received images' pieces and informs the SwissRanger packet handler once they are ready to be 
retrieved. Table \ref{swissrangerpackethandlermethods} lists the method that the SwissRanger packet handler 
overrides from the \SafePacketHandler{} class.
